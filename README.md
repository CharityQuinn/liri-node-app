This project allows a user to enter a name of a *band, movie, concert or something to do* at the command of "node liri.js <type of data> <name of data>. 

This project will be useful if you want to be ##entertained by some musical sound or video.

If you have any questions, please **Slack** me a message.
I will maintain this project but it is only here with the tremendous help from my TAs and tutor.
